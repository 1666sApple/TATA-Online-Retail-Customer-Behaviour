# TATA: Online Retail Dataset - Machine Learning Model Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models for predicting customer purchase behavior using the TATA Online Retail Dataset. The tasks performed include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, training, testing, and result visualization.

## Dataset Description

The TATA Online Retail Dataset contains information about customer purchases and includes features such as product details, customer demographics, and transaction records.

## Files in Repository

- **Dataset:** Contains the TATA Online Retail Dataset.
- **.gitignore:** Specifies which files or directories to ignore in version control.
- **BS23-ML-Task-Customer-Purchase-Behavior.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the machine learning model implementation.
- **README.md:** This file providing an overview of the repository.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists the dependencies required to run the Jupyter Notebook.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, performed feature scaling, and applied dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted statistical analysis and utilized visualization techniques to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and patterns in the data.

3. **Machine Learning Model Implementation:** Implemented various machine learning algorithms including XGBoost, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and an ensemble model combining Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets, trained the models on the training set, and evaluated their performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics.

5. **Result Visualization:** Visualized the results of the models using plots or charts to illustrate performance metrics and insights gained from the analysis.
